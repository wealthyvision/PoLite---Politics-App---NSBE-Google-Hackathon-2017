# PoLite - Politics App - NSBE Google Hackathon 2017


This is a politics app designed by a group of students from the National society of Black Engineers. We have joined a Google NSBE Hackathon in 2017 and are now publishing our files to contribute to on Github. 

This code acts like a search engine. We are trying to refine this search engine to properly work. All ideas are welcome. This project is written in Python.
